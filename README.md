# BetterBlenderCOD
A Blender (4.0+) plugin for importing/exporting XModels and XAnims, forked from [here](https://github.com/marv7000/BetterBlenderCOD). Tested with Call of Duty&reg; 2 only.

It is a continuation for the original Blender 2.7 addon by SE2Dev and CoDEmanX, made compatible with the newest Blender API versions.

# Install
